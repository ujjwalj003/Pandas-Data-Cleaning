# README: Data Cleaning Using Pandas

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning workflow using the powerful Python library Pandas. We work with a sample fitness dataset that includes various fields such as Duration, Date, Pulse, Maxpulse, and Calories. This dataset contains different kinds of dirty data issues like missing values, incorrect formats, invalid data entries, and duplicates.

## Why Data Cleaning?

Real-world data is often incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent. Cleaning the data ensures:

* Better performance of data analysis
* Improved model accuracy in machine learning
* Reliable and valid insights

## Objectives

1. Understand various common data quality issues
2. Learn how to handle them systematically using Pandas
3. Prepare a clean dataset ready for analysis or modeling

## Workflow Summary

We will divide our data cleaning process into four key steps:

### 1. Cleaning Empty Cells

* Identify rows with missing data (NaN)
* Remove rows with too many missing values
* Fill missing values using a constant, mean, median, or mode

### 2. Cleaning Wrong Format

* Convert incorrect string types to valid datetime or numerical formats
* Standardize the date field

### 3. Cleaning Wrong Data

* Identify values outside acceptable ranges (e.g., duration > 300 minutes)
* Replace or remove invalid entries

### 4. Removing Duplicates

* Detect and remove duplicated rows to avoid repeated data skewing the analysis

Each step is illustrated with Python code using Pandas and explained thoroughly in separate markdown files to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
